<h1>
    Unit, Integration, and Acceptance Testing
</h1>
<h2>As you progress from Unit Testing -> Integration Testing -> Acceptance Testing: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>longer runtime</li>
        <li>more expensive to write </li>
        <li>harder to troubleshoot</li>

    </ul>


    <h2> <em>Unit Testing</em> is low level of testing performed by programmers that validates individual "<em>units</em>" of code <em>function as intended by the programmer</em>. Always automated.  </h2>
   
    <h2> <em>Integration Testing</em> is a broad category of tests that validate the integration between units of code or code and outside dependencies such as databases or network resources.</h2>
	<h3>Integration tests:</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Use the same tools as unit tests</li>
	<li>Usually slower than unit tests</li>
	<li>Are more complex to write and debug</li>
	<li>Can have dependencies on outside resources like files or a database</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Integration tests should test CRUD operations</h3>
	<h3>Integration tests, like unit tests, should be </h3>
	<ul>
	<li>Repeatable</li>
	<li>Independent</li>
	<li>Obvious</li>
	</ul>
	
 <h2> <em>Acceptance Testing</em> is performed from the perspective of a user of the system in order to verify that the functionality of the system satisfies user needs.</h2>
