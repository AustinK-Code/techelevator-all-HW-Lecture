    <h1><em>Keys</em> are used to create relationships between tables. </h1>
    <h2><em>Natural keys </em> are formed from values in the real world (SSN, ISBN, tax id)</h2>
    <h2><em>Surrogate keys </em>  are artificially created by the application and identify a unique record.</h2>
    <h2><em>Primary keys </em> uniquely identify each row within a table. They cannot be duplicated within that table
         and cannot be null. It is typically a single column but can also be comprised of multiple columns.</h2>
    <h2><em>Foreign keys </em> exist in other tables and are used to reference a primary key in the source table.</h2>
    <h1><em>Cardinality</em> refers to the maximum number of times that an instance in one entity can be associated 
        with instances in a related entity, along with the minimum number of times it must be associated.</h1>
    
    <h1> <em>SQL Joins</em> allow us to create queries that produce data from one or more tables</h1>
    <h2>Joins can be <em>inner</em> or <em>outer</em>. </h2>
