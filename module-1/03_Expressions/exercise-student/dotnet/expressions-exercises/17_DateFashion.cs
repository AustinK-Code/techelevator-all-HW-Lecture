        You and your date are trying to get a table at a restaurant. The parameter "you" is the stylishness
        of your clothes, in the range 0..10, and "date" is the stylishness of your date's clothes. The result
        returned will be 0 if you did not get the table, 1 if you might get the table, and 2 if you did get
        the table. If you or your date is very stylish (8 or more), then the result is 2 (yes). With the
        exception that if either of you has style of 2 or less, then the result is 0 (no). Otherwise the
        result is 1 (maybe).
