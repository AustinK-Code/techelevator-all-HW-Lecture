         * in the string and also as the last 2 chars of the string, so "hixxxhi" yields 1.
         *
         * We don't count the end substring, but the substring may overlap a prior position by one.  For instance, "xxxx"
         * has a count of 2, one pair at position 0, and the second at position 1. The third pair at position 2 is the
         * end substring, which we don't count.
         *
         * Return Dictionary<string, int>, where the key is string from the array, and its last2 count.
